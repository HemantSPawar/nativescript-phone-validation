/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.app-btn {
  font-size: 18;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10;
  color: white;
  background-color: #1ab0fd;
  border-radius:20;
}

.center {
  text-align: center;
}

.fa { font-family: 'FontAwesome'; }

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
